I’m a data science undergrad at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln focused on making messy data usable. I build automated data pipelines (Python/SQL) that ensure reliability, and apply statistical and machine-learning methods to deliver insights people can act on.

Outside of school, I love exercising and binge watching dramas. Poke around my website to learn more!
