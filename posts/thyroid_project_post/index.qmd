## **Thyroid Cancer Prediction through Machine Learning methods**

-   **Description:** The project utilizes machine learning to predict thyroid cancer risk based on patient data obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushpanday1/thyroid-cancer-risk-prediction-dataset/data). The datasets were preprocessed by encoding categorical variables and standardizing numerical features. A **Random Forest Classifier** was trained on an 80-20 train-test split, achieving an **82.45% accuracy**. The model’s performance was evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix visualization. 

### **Confusion Matrix**

Here is the confusion matrix for the model’s predictions:
