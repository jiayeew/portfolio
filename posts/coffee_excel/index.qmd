## **Interactive Excel Dashboard: Coffee Bean Sales Analysis**

-   **Description:** This project features an interactive coffee sales dashboard built in Excel, to efficiently track and analyze coffee bean sales. The dataset was obtained from [mochen862's GitHub](https://github.com/mochen862/excel-project-coffee-sales/blob/main/coffeeOrdersData.xlsx).  The dashboard incorporates **XLOOKUP** to retrieve customer data and **INDEX MATCH** to pull product details, providing accurate and efficient data lookup. It also incorporates **Pivot Tables**, **Slicers**, and a **Timeline** for dynamic filtering, allowing users to explore sales trends seamlessly. These visualizations help businesses optimizeales strategies and better understand customer purchasing behaviors.

- Key features include:
     - Graphs displaying total sales over time, sales by country, and the top 5 customers.
     - Filters for roast type, product size, and loyalty card status using slicers.
     - The IF function to rename abbreviations for better readability.

Here is a screenshot of the dashboard and a screen recording of the formula used:
