## **Valentine’s Day Animated Heart**

-   **Description:** In celebration of Valentine’s Day, this project generates an animated heart visualization using the Tkinter library. The heart shape is mathematically defined using parametric equations, with additional effects such as diffusion, shrinking, and a halo that create a glowing, scattered appearance.

Here is a screen recording of the animation:
