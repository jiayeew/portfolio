Statistical analyses, including t-tests, ANOVA, and correlations, were used to evaluate injury costs and causes. The findings indicate that non-office environments contribute a greater proportion of total injury costs (30.81%) compared to office environments (23.88%). Office-related injuries, though less frequent, often involve same-level falls and may carry higher costs per incident. Non-office injuries are primarily caused by falls to lower levels and being struck by objects. Regional injury rates vary across states, suggesting the need for localized safety assessments. Targeted prevention strategies are recommended, particularly in office environments, to reduce fall-related incidents.\nBusiness Report\nPresentation Slides\nOffice Comparion R-code\nState Comparion R-code"
